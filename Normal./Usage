This distribution is usually used when we are picking one thing out of many things. All kinds of variables are somehow normally distributed. 
Here is some examples: 
Height of people, Blood pressure,...
We usually use it because it's simple to explain according to it's mean and mode and standard deviation. 
While sampeling, when the number of our samples grow, the distribiution gets close to normal distribution(Centeral Limit Theorem).
