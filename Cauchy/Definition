The Cauchy distribution(the Lorentz distribution), is a family of continuous probably distributions which resemble the normal distribution family of curves and it's symmetric.
it has a taller peak than a normal and unlike the normal distribution, it’s fat tails fall much more slowly.
The Cauchy distribution is well known for the fact that it’s expected value and other moments do not exist.The median and mode do exist and they are equal. 
However, the Central Limit theorem doesn’t work for the limiting distribution of the mean.
